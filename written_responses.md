1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

A regular expression is a non-turing complete outgrowth of formal language, that uses
a set of symbols to represent the properties of patterns, that can then be applied to a string,
to locate any sequences that have the corresponding properties of the pattern.

2. What is an array and how does it work?

An array is a general data structure, that is stored in a contiguous block of memory,
the size of which is set upon the initialization of the array, that can hold a discrete
number of elements of the same type, which can be located via their indexes, which are the
result of a small mathematical equation based on the memory address and the byte size of the data type.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

A hash table is a data structure that allows for more flexible keys, 
as opposed to arrays, which only have sequential integers for keys.
Hash tables are built upon an arrays, in that a hash function is applied to a string,
the result of which is then fed to a modulus operation with a number representing
the upper bound of elements that can be in the array, allowing for fast look up.
